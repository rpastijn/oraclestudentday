# Verify Compute Instance Setup

## Introduction
This lab will show you how to login to your pre-created compute instance running on Oracle Cloud.

*Estimated Time*: 5 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Learn how to connect to your compute instance using Remote Desktop

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
- Successfully submitted a reservation using the "*Reserve Workshop on LiveLabs*" option
- Your reservation has been Successfully executed and valid remote desktop URL provided in the output

## Task 1: Access the Graphical Remote Desktop
For ease of execution of this workshop, your VM instance has been pre-configured with a remote graphical desktop accessible using any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to login.

1. Now that your instance has been provisioned, navigate to ***My Reservations***, find the request you submitted from the list displayed (only one item will be displayed if this is your first request).

    *Note:* While rare, you may see an error titled “*Deceptive Site Ahead*” or similar depending on your browser type as shown below.

    Public IP addresses used for LiveLabs provisioning comes from a pool of reusable addresses and this error is due to the fact that the address was previously used by a compute instance long terminated, but that wasn't properly secured, got compromised and was flagged.

    You can safely ignore and proceed by clicking on *Details*, and finally on *Visit this unsafe site*.

You may now proceed to the next lab.
